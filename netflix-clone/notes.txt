How to check what's running on what port?

`lsof -i :3000`

=== Installing ESLint, Prettier ===
Use: 

`exec 3<&1;bash <&3 <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlhadwen/eslint-prettier-airbnb-react/master/eslint-prettier-config.sh 2> /dev/null)`

=== Neat Tricks ===
If you want to check the state of something without using the console, use:

`<pre>{JSON.stringify(toggleShow, null, 2)}</pre>`

here is OptForm duplicated code, can we have it as a container to keep things DRY?
